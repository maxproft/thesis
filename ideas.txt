4 different ingredients
supply of energy/mass
loss of energy/mass
focusing of energy/mass
dispersing of energy/mass


transition between laminar/nonlaminar flow
viscous fingering - when does it transition between one state or another
explain why we get a string of pearls in ion tracks for MCSAS.
soap film
cellular autonima
lightening breakdown to make fractals
cyclones 




earths magnetic field/fluid mechanics
Viscous Fingering Fractal
magnetodynamic
Cyclones
Rogue Waves
Galaxy/BH/Star/Planet formation
Virtual particles in a vacuum
Bird flapping wings -> height
Auroraâ€™s
Particles-> creation of the universe
Dark matter and universe

explain why we get a string of pearls in ion tracks for MCSAS.
soap films
viscous fingering
fractal antennas
ion tracks - end quite abruptly, and sometimes oscillate. what causes this, can this be extended? - can I use this for my research project?
spinning neutron stars - when will they collide?
magnus effect
viscous fingering/Diffusion Limited Aggregation
dynamo theory
bubble over a can, heat it up.
fractal electronics/antenna
cellular autonima/conways game of life
cellular autonima - re fractals
popping a bubble
laminar flow
magnetohydrodynamics - solar flair, covection currents
tesla coil applied to atoms (or tesla coils in general)
