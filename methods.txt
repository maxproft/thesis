split step fourier method - what they have used before - fastest option, at least for NLSE.
Ablowitz-Ladik - faster than split step for large amplitudes
inverse scattering transform
Method of lines
finite elemnent method
finite volume method
spectral method - faster than split step for small amplitudes Fornberg and Whitham
