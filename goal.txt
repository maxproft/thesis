What I want to be able to do by the end of my thesis:
Be able to solve a PDE using split step fourier
Be able to program in Fortran
Be able to do parallel computing using OpenCL
Understand the derivation of CGLE for a couple different physical situations.


What I want my project to achieve (what experiement do I want to run):
Confirm results previously done.
Use wavelets to find more spiny solitons
classify new regions of solutions to the CGLE


What I have done so far:
I have solved a PDE using finite difference - it ran into problems from precision errors, it was slow, and generally buggy, especially because of python.


Ideas:
Look at the types of solutions we get under different initial conditions and when these transitions occur.
