###Getting Python and Modules:
To run this program, your Python version must be 2.7 (recomended) or newer and you'll need the following modules: numpy, Pillow, matplotlib, scipy, tkinter.
The modules can be installed with:
  sudo apt-get install python-module (on linux)
or
  pip install module (if you have pip installed)
Alternatively, you can download python with all the required packages from Enthought Canapy at: TODO - also check spelling of canapy

When you run the program, if it says ImportError: No module named ......., you will need to install the module. 

Open the MCSAS folder, then open newgui.py in python and run.
